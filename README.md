=========

A replacement for the ION Login page on the campus of MIT, Manipal.

**If there are issues, please [report them in the issues page](https://github.com/hawklings/loginion/issues)**


Installing
==========

Head over to the [Downloads](#) section and download the package for your platform (Window, Mac OS, or Linux)


Mission / Why?
==============

We all know ION is kinda sucky. We love you guys for giving us Internet, but there are
a lot of ways this could be improved.

This is an effort by some students in Manipal to try and open channels of communication
between us and ION by doing the thing we do best - writing code.

We would like to show that the students (and faculty) of MIT support good UI, thoughtful
design, and above all, *deserve* a better Internet experience that the one available
right now. 

This application can help relieve some of the burden on the usability side of things,
but we have no control of the servers. However, by initiating this project, we would love
to start a dialog that will hopefully allow us to improve the Internet infrastructure as a
whole in MIT.

**TL;DR** - we like Internet. We like pretty things. Let's make our Internet access pretty.
